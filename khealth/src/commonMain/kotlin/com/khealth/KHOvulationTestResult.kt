/**
 * An ovulation test checks for a rise in a hormone called luteinizing hormone (LH) in your urine,
 * which happens just before ovulation.
 *
 * - **Positive**: The test shows a high level of LH, meaning ovulation is likely happening soon.
 * - **Negative**: No rise in LH, meaning you're not close to ovulation yet.
 * - **High**: The test detects a very high LH level, indicating youâ€™re near or at ovulation.
 * - **Inconclusive**: The test results are unclear, often due to factors like incorrect usage or a
 * faulty test.
